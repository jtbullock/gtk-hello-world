# gtk-hello-world

This is my playground project for learning gtk4 and experimenting with using it to display media.

## Running

`make run`

Since I'm just experimenting, resources are referenced with relative paths in the code.
So it's important to run the executable from the same directory as assets
(currently set up to be the project root).

## Dependencies

* gtk4
* pkg-config
